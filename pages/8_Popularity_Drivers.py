    1.  **Energy and Popularity:** The correlation coefficient between **Energy** and **Popularity** is **$\mathbf{{r = {energy_corr:.4f}}}$**. This value is extremely close to zero, meaning there is **no strong linear correlation** between the two. While energy *levels* have increased over time, the energy of a single track is not a primary driver of its modern popularity score.
    2.  **Key Popularity Drivers:** The features with the highest (though still weak) positive correlation are **Danceability** and **Loudness**. This suggests that popular tracks tend to be slightly easier to move to and produced at a higher volume.
    3.  **Key Popularity Inhibitors:** The features with the strongest negative correlation are **Instrumentalness**, **Liveness**, and **Acousticness**. Tracks that are perceived as heavily acoustic, recorded live, or purely instrumental are generally **less** likely to achieve a high popularity score in this dataset.
