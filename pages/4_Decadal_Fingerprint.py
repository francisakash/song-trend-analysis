### üí° Summary of Decadal Change (1950s to 2020s)

The analysis of popular songs shows a fundamental shift in listener preference over time:

* **Louder & Energetic:** There is a clear trend toward **higher average Energy** and **Loudness** ($\approx+3.3$ dB), reflecting increased digital production and the impact of the "loudness war."
* **Less Acoustic:** **Acousticness has dropped dramatically** ($\approx-0.49$), indicating a move away from natural/live sounds toward synthesized or electronically processed music.
* **More Danceable, Less Happy:** Songs are **more Danceable** ($\approx+0.08$) but notably **less Positive (lower Valence)** ($\approx-0.22$). People are increasingly choosing tracks that are built for movement but carry a more serious or aggressive emotional tone.
